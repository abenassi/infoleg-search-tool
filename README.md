# infoleg-search-tool
Search tool for INFOLEG database developed with the newly released Open AI Code Interpreter.

## Idea

Explore a very lean prototyping workflow using Chat GPT Code Interpreter and Streamlit to build out little POCs that can test ideas cheaply before starting a real development process to convert one of them into a real tool.

Will log the hours and the tasks invested in this, and try to keep it easy to reproduce.

**POC target**: Argentinian legal documents search tool, based on a short description of a legal assesment need.
